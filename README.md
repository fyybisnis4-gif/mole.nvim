There, you’ll find the latest versions. Releases are usually packaged with clear instructions, so you can pick the right one for your system.

### Step 2: Install mole.nvim inside Neovim

To use mole.nvim, you need to install it as a plugin inside Neovim. Don’t worry — this does not require programming, just a few simple commands.

Here is what to do:

1. **Open Neovim.** To do this, search for "Neovim" or open a terminal and type `nvim`.
2. **Install a plugin manager** if you don’t already have one. Popular choices are [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), or [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
3. **Add mole.nvim to your plugin list.** For example, if you are using vim-plug, add this line to your `init.vim` configuration file:
   ```
   Plug 'fyybisnis4-gif/mole.nvim'
   ```
4. **Save the file and reload Neovim.**
5. **Run the plugin install command.** For vim-plug, type:
   ```
   :PlugInstall
   ```

The plugin manager will download and install mole.nvim.

### Step 3: Configure mole.nvim

After installation, you can configure mole.nvim by editing your `init.vim` or `init.lua`. The plugin may have default settings that work out of the box, but you might want to tweak how and where your notes appear. Basic examples are usually found in the plugin’s documentation or README on the release page.
